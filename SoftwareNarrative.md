## Software Engineering Narrative
For the software engineering project, I created a 3D model of an object (reminiscent of a silo) on top of a floor with two different light sources. The software was written in C++ using OpenGL libraries. It was originally created last year, but most of the content was created during this enhancement process.<br/><br/>
The visualization of a 3D model was a good way to show the interactive aspects of coding in a more memorable context. Different objects are developed and implemented using classes along with the associated methods for coloring, texturing, and lighting. The amount of content from the original project was increased dramatically.<br/><br/>
Through the enhancements, I was able to retain and understand a lot more of the processes and information clearly. By working alone without a guide, I was forced to comb through the content and comprehend the minor details. Header files became invaluable as the content grew and the lines became too much to handle with one file.<br/><br/>
