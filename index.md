## Matthew's Computer Science Capstone

For my final project for a Bachelor's in Computer Science, I have collected a series of smaller applications that showcase some of the different skills I have obtained through my time with the university.

### Self-Assessment
Please take a moment to read this short, [professional self-assessment](MatthewModderman.github.io/Self-Assessment.html). 
The assessment explains why I created this website and what I hope to show through the different applications. 

### Pre-Redesign Code Review
Before examining each program in its upgraded state, please take a moment to look at the [original code review](https://youtu.be/tXYA8rwRL7s). To make this more user-friendly, there are links to each of the main sections:<br/>
