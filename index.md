## Matthew's Computer Science Capstone

For my final project for a Bachelor's in Computer Science, I have collected a series of smaller applications that showcase some of the different skills I have obtained through my time with the university.

### Self-Assessment
It has been a little over two years since beginning my path towards a Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science. Prior to enrolling for this degree, I worked in customer service-oriented fields such as marketing and restaurants. Although I am currently still employed in a marketing firm, my goal is to contribute to a more intellectually demanding field. The Computer Science industry caught my attention and pulled me in because of its relevance and influence on modern life, the wholistic approach necessary to succeed, and the continuous advancements in efficiency.<br/><br/>
Following this introduction is a group of three smaller projects that I had the opportunity to work on in previous courses. The projects include:
> A simple 3D model using Phong lighting, designed using OpenGL<br/> 
> A conglomerate of scripts that showcase a few different data structures and how they can be used to manipulate information through the appropriate algorithms<br/>
> A short CLI-based program that works with JSON objects using Python to implement the CRUD model on a NoSQL database (MongoDB).<br/>
Through the different artifacts, you will be able to get an idea of my current technical abilities. The purpose of conducting three different projects using two different languages was to showcase my willingness to stretch outside of my comfort zone. Although these projects will show my intent for design, interest in the different fields, and security driven mindset, there are other points of my education and current ability that are not present.<br/><br/>
Three key points that should be stated outside of these projects include my willingness to learn and adapt when faced with new ideas, my ability to work in a group or as an individual, and my ability to communicate information efficiently through different mediums. These three points are highly useful, transferable skills that will help propel my understanding and abilities when faced with difficulties.

### Pre-Redesign Code Review
Before examining each program in its upgraded state, please take a moment to look at the [original code review](https://youtu.be/tXYA8rwRL7s). To make this more user-friendly, there are links to each of the main sections:<br/>

## Software Engineering
[1. Software Engineering Section of Pre-Redesign Code Review](https://youtu.be/tXYA8rwRL7s?t=335)<br/><br/>
For the software engineering project, I created a 3D model of an object (reminiscent of a silo) on top of a floor with two different light sources. The software was written in C++ using OpenGL libraries. It was originally created last year, but most of the content was created during this enhancement process.<br/><br/>
The visualization of a 3D model was a good way to show the interactive aspects of coding in a more memorable context. Different objects are developed and implemented using classes along with the associated methods for coloring, texturing, and lighting. The amount of content from the original project was increased dramatically.<br/><br/>
Through the enhancements, I was able to retain and understand a lot more of the processes and information clearly. By working alone without a guide, I was forced to comb through the content and comprehend the minor details. Header files became invaluable as the content grew and the lines became too much to handle with one file.<br/><br/>

## Data Structures & Algorithms
[2. Data Structures & Algorithms Section of Pre-Redesign Code Review](https://youtu.be/tXYA8rwRL7s?t=956)<br/><br/>
For the algorithm and data structure project, I took a series of separate scripts relating to manipulating a specific csv file. In this case, the csv file refers to a decently large collection of bids from an auction. The original project was from somewhere close to early 2019. This final project included creating an interface to use all of the different scripts, prevention against improper user inputs, and presenting the data structures and algorithms in a way that valuable information could be produced for business decisions.<br/><br/> 
For my final project for my capstone class for my degree, there had to be proof of the use and manipulation of different data structures using algorithms. This project hit that directly on the nose, so I figured it was beneficial to showcase the work. This project made evident the value of data structures and building appropriate and meaningful algorithms around those structures. The different structures show the importance of encapsulation, while the algorithms show the benefits and time associated with using different types of algorithms.<br/><br/>
In the beginning, there was no structure to this project. Each data structure script was written separately so the entire project appeared meaningless. Issues arose in the logic as the pieces were brought together into one program. Through proactively and meticulously investigating each point of the program, I was ableto uncover and rectify errors associated with user-inputs. There may be more errors that have not been uncovered, but that can be checked and altered through continuous testing.<br/><br/>

## NoSQL Database
[3. NoSQL Database Section of Pre-Redesign Code Review](https://youtu.be/tXYA8rwRL7s?t=1310)<br/><br/>
The following is a program built using Python to access JSON structured objects in a MongoDB, NoSQL database. This was another project I had completed last year, so I had to go back and work my way through what had been created. The CRUDProgram.py imports all of the other scripts to be used through the CLI. For this section (databases), I figured it would be best to use NoSQL since it is more pliable. The scripts show the use of another language, manipulating another data structure (JSON objects), and modularly designing software.<br/><br/>
When I first revisited this project, all of the work was saved on a third-party site (codio.com). I was able to pull all the data and scripts and download the proper software for them to interact through the CLI on my computer. I was then able to pull all the pieces together, repackage the product, increase the functionality, comment the code, and built it into a single program that utilizes Python 3.8.<br/><br/>
Going back and reworking past projects helps to create mental connection on how every facet of computer design works together. The more I go back and rework these projects, the more I recognize their potential value in analyzing information for a business. By pulling the scripts and data from the third-party site and working on them locally, I was able to better understand the functionality and relationship between the CLI, MongoDB database, and Python scripts.<br/><br/>
My biggest issue was getting everything to work on my system. Once I got all of the software and scripts set up properly, I had to remember the calls used for NoSQL to build up the project. What I found though, was that revisiting these ideas made it easier to research and apply concepts than it had been before.<br/><br/>
