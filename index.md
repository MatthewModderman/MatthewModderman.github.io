### Self-Assessment
Please take a moment to read this short, [professional self-assessment](MatthewModderman.github.io/Self-Assessment.htm). 
The assessment explains why I created this website and what I hope to show through the different applications. 

### Pre-Redesign Code Review
Before examining each program in its upgraded state, please take a moment to look at the [original code review](https://youtu.be/tXYA8rwRL7s). To make this more user-friendly, there are links to each of the main sections of the review.
