It has been a little over two years since beginning my path towards a Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science.</br> 
Prior to enrolling for this degree, I worked in customer service-oriented fields such as marketing and</br>  
restaurants. Although I am currently still employed in a marketing firm, my goal is to contribute to a</br>  
more intellectually demanding field. The Computer Science industry caught my attention and pulled me in</br>  
because of its relevance and influence on modern life, the wholistic knowledge base necessary to succeed,</br>  
and the continuous advancements in knowledge and efficiency. 
</p>
<p>
Following this introduction is a group of three smaller projects that I had the opportunity to work on in</br>  
previous courses. The projects include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>a simple 3D model using Phong lighting, designed using OpenGL</li> 
<li>a conglomerate of scripts that showcase a few different data structures and how they can be</br> 
used to manipulate information through the appropriate algorithms</li>
<li>a short CLI-based program that works with JSON objects using Python to implement the CRUD model</br> 
on a NoSQL database (MongoDB).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Through the different artifacts, you will be able to get an idea of my current technical abilities. The</br>  
purpose of conducting three different projects using two different languages was to showcase my willingness</br>  
to stretch outside of my comfort zone. Although these projects will show my intent for design, interest in</br>  
the different fields, and security driven mindset, there are other points of my education and current ability</br>  
that are not present.
</p>
<p>
Three key points that should be stated outside of these projects include my willingness to learn and adapt</br>  
when faced with new ideas, my ability to work in a group or as an individual, and my ability to communicate</br>  
information efficiently through different mediums. These three points are highly useful, transferable skills</br>  
that will help propel my understanding and abilities when faced with difficulties.</br>
