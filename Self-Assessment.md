## Self-Assessment
It has been a little over two years since beginning my path towards a Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science.<br/> 
Prior to enrolling for this degree, I worked in customer service-oriented fields such as marketing and<br/>  
restaurants. Although I am currently still employed in a marketing firm, my goal is to contribute to a<br/>  
more intellectually demanding field. The Computer Science industry caught my attention and pulled me in<br/> 
because of its relevance and influence on modern life, the wholistic approach necessary to succeed,<br/>  
and the continuous advancements in efficiency.<br/><br/>  
Following this introduction is a group of three smaller projects that I had the opportunity to work on in<br/>  
previous courses. The projects include:<br/>
a simple 3D model using Phong lighting, designed using OpenGL<br/> 
a conglomerate of scripts that showcase a few different data structures and how they can be<br/> 
used to manipulate information through the appropriate algorithms<br/>
a short CLI-based program that works with JSON objects using Python to implement the CRUD model<br/> 
on a NoSQL database (MongoDB).<br/>
Through the different artifacts, you will be able to get an idea of my current technical abilities. The<br/> 
purpose of conducting three different projects using two different languages was to showcase my willingness<br/>  
to stretch outside of my comfort zone. Although these projects will show my intent for design, interest in<br/>  
the different fields, and security driven mindset, there are other points of my education and current ability<br/>  
that are not present.<br>
Three key points that should be stated outside of these projects include my willingness to learn and adapt<br/> 
when faced with new ideas, my ability to work in a group or as an individual, and my ability to communicate<br/>  
information efficiently through different mediums. These three points are highly useful, transferable skills<br/>  
that will help propel my understanding and abilities when faced with difficulties.<br/>
